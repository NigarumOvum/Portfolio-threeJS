        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
I consider myself as a passionate computer science student, always curious and excited about the new technology trends
with a relentless attention to details. With strong bias for action and ability to operate independently, sharpen
communication and organization skills with an ability to thrive in a fast-paced production deadline-driven environment.

For the SDLC I have experience with Waterfall/Agile/scrum/Kanban methodologies. Building Web Applications using many
design patterns such as: MVC (Model Views Controller), MVVM (Model ViewModel View), MVP (Model View Presenter) and MVT
(Model View Template). Also, use programming paradigms such as: OOP (Object Oriented Programming), DDD (domain-driven
design) and architectural patterns such as: Layered, Pipe-Filter, Client-Server, Event Bus, Microservices, Broken,
Peer-To-Peer, Black Board and Master-Slave.        </p>

        <p>
For the STLC I have experience with manual and automated tests at functional, non-functional & maintenance macro-level.
